## --- Part Two ---

Even with your help, the sorting process  _still_  isn't fast enough.

One of the Elves comes up with a new plan: rather than sort parts individually
through all of these workflows, maybe you can figure out in advance which
combinations of ratings will be accepted or rejected.

Each of the four ratings (`x`,  `m`,  `a`,  `s`) can have an integer value
ranging from a minimum of  `1`  to a maximum of  `4000`. Of  _all possible
distinct combinations_  of ratings, your job is to figure out which ones will be
_accepted_.

In the above example, there are  `_167409079868000_`  distinct combinations of
ratings that will be accepted.

Consider only your list of workflows; the list of part ratings that the Elves
wanted you to sort is no longer relevant.  _How many distinct combinations of
ratings will be accepted by the Elves' workflows?_
